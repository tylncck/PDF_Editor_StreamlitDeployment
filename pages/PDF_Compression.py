    Welcome to the PDF Compression Tool! Choose a compression method and upload your PDF file below. 
    The tool supports two compression methods: **PyPDF2 Compression** and **Ghostscript Compression**.
    
    - **PyPDF2 Compression:** This method uses the PyPDF2 library to compress PDF files.
    - **Ghostscript Compression:** This method uses Ghostscript to compress PDF files.
    
    For Ghostscript Compression, you will have two options: Screen and eBook

    - **Screen Compression:** Optimized for quick online viewing, "Screen" settings reduce file size and resolution, ideal for web pages and electronic presentations.
    - **eBook Compression:** Balance between quality and size. Offering better resolution than "Screen," perfect for digital publications and e-reader compatibility.
    
    First upload the PDF file you wish to compress. Then click the **Compress PDF** button to start the compression process. 
    The compressed file will be available for download once the process is complete.
